In this project, we developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model utilizing SecBERT, BiLSTM, and CRF to effectively identify and classify named entities within text. The model demonstrated impressive results, achieving a highest accuracy of 96.43%. During training, the model exhibited a significant decrease in training loss, indicating optimal learning and effective minimization of classification error. The performance was visually corroborated through graphs depicting training loss and validation accuracy across epochs, underscoring the model's robust capacity to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, inference results on sample sentences illustrated the model's efficiency in correctly labeling entities, validating its potential for real-world applications in various domains of natural language processing.
